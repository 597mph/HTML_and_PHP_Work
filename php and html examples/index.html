  <br><br><br>
  <h1>Questions?</h1>
  <ul class="incremental">
      <li>Question 1: Where have you been?<br>
          I will probably misinterpret this question, but I've been to Spain, China,
          Italy, France, and Belize, amongst some other countries and states in the US.
          I skied on the West Coast a few times, and on the East Coast almost every year. I love ice skating.
          I have lived in Connecticut my whole life, and moved from New Haven to Clinton in 2012.
          I transferred from Union College in 2016, and have been attending SCSU part time since then.</li>
      <li>Question 2: Where are you now?<br>
          I am still living in Clinton at the moment, but that will change at the end of next year when I graduate. I commuted from home for a couple years, but have been taking classes remotely ever since COVID happened.
          Online classes are easier for me.</li>
      <li>Question 3: Where are you going?<br>
          Honestly, I have no idea yet. I've been focusing on graduating for a while now, and I'm happy to finally almost be there. My brother and I should be graduating around the same time, and when that happens we will probably move in together somewhere along with a mutual friend.
          I am hoping to do something related to either web dev/design, software development, video game development, or database management. Ultimately, I'll be happy doing mostly anything technology or IT related.</li>
      <li>Question 4: Which of data networking, content, style, and behavior are your strengths or areas you wish to improve?<br>
          I would say I am fairly skilled working with content and styling. There is room for improvement when it comes to data networking and behavior. I am confident this class will teach me some important skills pertaining to all four areas.</li>
      <li>Question 5: Among the recommended reading, what interests you? What concerns you? What is familiar to you?<br>
          I'm interested in pretty much anything technology related. Except crypto. I don't like crypto because it's terrible for the environment. I found pretty much all of the recommended readings interesting. I am familiar with some readings on HTML, IP, and TCP. I had not read the last couple readings and found them very cool. The only technology that concerns me is AI. Albeit I am very fascinated by the concept of AI, but
          it obviously has the potential to be very dangerous if misused.</li>

    <li>Certain IDEs can interact directly with the public internet via either extensions, plugins, or the code written within the IDE itself.</li>
    <li>Every IDE is different, but ultimately the end product (application, program, software, or website) would use one or more types of internet protocol (HTTP, HTML, PHP, TCP, UDP, etc.)
        depending on how the product is developed.</li>
